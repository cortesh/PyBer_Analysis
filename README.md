# Overview of the school district analysis:
Conduct an analysis of PyBer car sharing ride data to discover trends.
## Deliverables will include:
* a summary DateFrame by city type
* a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

## Results:

A cursory glance at the Summary DataFrame reveals that urban city types yeild the highest total revenues. This is to be expected since by their very definition, they are more densely populated and hold larger populations which corrolates with a higher customer base and greater demand for rides.  However, what is less obvious is that the average fare is highest in rural city types.  While not explicitly identified, it stands to reason that rural city types are less densely populated and would require longer traveling distances between destinations, driving up costs per ride.  What is also true is that rural city types have far fewer rides in absolute numbers (125 vs 1,625) blunting the profititability of their higher per ride average fare.  While more statistical analysis is required, suburban rides may combine higher per ride fares with similar frequency to yeild a higher rider/fare profit ratio.
